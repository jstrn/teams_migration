# This file is no longer needed!
# Dependencies are managed automatically by uv via inline script metadata in classify_and_report.py and backup_sharepoint_to_azure.py
#
# If you still want to use pip/venv for some reason:
pandas>=1.5.0
openpyxl>=3.0.0
msal>=1.24.0
requests>=2.31.0
azure-storage-blob>=12.19.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
loguru>=0.7.0
#
# But we recommend using uv for zero-configuration setup!
